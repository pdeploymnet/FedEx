          <p>
            Ethics explores the logical reasons behind our moral judgments and investigates what actions are morally
            right or wrong,
            fair, or unfair. (Canada, 2015)
            In this module, participants will explore strategic concepts and their significance at FedEx. They will
            learn how ethics
            affects decision-making and will work across the organization. Participants will be encouraged to share
            their thoughts
            on negative practices that can occur in daily work, thus encouraging support and open discussion. These
            standards are
            designed to raise awareness of conflicts one may face and to emphasize the importance of ethical behavior in
            protecting
            FedEx's reputation as a reputable busines

          </div>
          <p>
            Ethical theories are methods for determining what is right and what is wrong. They instruct us on how we
            should act and
            make decisions. There are all sorts of ethical theories: those that focus on rules and those that emphasize
            the
            repercussions of our acts. (Larry Chonko, 2012)
            Module 2 will introduce FedEx's ethical principles, which can lead participants to important values such as
            honesty,
            trust, and customer focus. Participants will learn how to follow the company's mission and vision to promote
            and grow a
            culture of responsibility and ethics. This model will demonstrate the positive impact of following an
            ethical
            perspective on the company's reputation and stakeholder relations.<br>

            applied across
            various industries. They can look for real examples of how the company has acted ethically in the past. The
            model will
            encourage participants to consider how these ethical principles can be applied to their roles and
            decision-making
            processes. How they can train other employees and check their ethical behavior towards our customers.

            Work ethics refers to the way people work and the skills they need to do well. Successful individuals
            usually have these
            qualities. It includes things like being good at managing time, being reliable, disciplined, always on time,
            having a
            positive attitude, working hard, and being a team player. (Cooks-Campbell, 2022)
            Module 3 will address the importance of ethics within the FedEx team and throughout the organization.
            Participants can learn about the positive impact of ethical behavior on work teams, employee participation,
            and customer
            satisfaction. The model will emphasize that the principle of fairness can create a good working environment
            where
            conflict can be resolved appropriately. Moreover, this will impact our company’s values in a better way as
            rules and
            regulations will be for everyone inside the company.<br><br>

            This model will emphasize the importance of effective communication and collaboration in reducing ethical
            challenges.

            Leadership is the skill of a person or a group to guide and influence the members of an organization,
            society, or team.
            (Barney, 2023)
            There are three styles of modules that are under as follows:
            1. Authoritarian Leaders are demanding and don’t allow negotiation, useful in urgent situations.
            2. Participative Leadership involves subordinates in decision-making, motivating them.
            3. Bureaucratic Leadership relies on hierarchical order and strict rules. (FedEx, n.d.)
            Lesson 4 will focus on the role of leadership in boosting values at FedEx. Participants will learn about the
            company's
            ethical culture and how leaders behave. This model will highlight the importance of managers providing
            support and
            guidance to employees in solving problems and handling customer issues.
